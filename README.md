## Problem Definition

Traditional attendance tracking methods are often time-consuming and prone to errors. The primary objective of our system is to automate the attendance process, making it efficient, accurate, and accessible from anywhere. With the integration of machine-based attendance tracking and manual attendance options, our system aims to address the challenges faced by educational institutions in managing attendance effectively.
